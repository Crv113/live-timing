# Live-timing

👋 Hey ! Part of the MXB Timing ecosystem, Live-timing is a Node.js script that listens to live UDP packets sent by the Mx Bikes game server to extract real-time telemetry and lap timing data.
This service acts as a bridge between the game and the Laravel backend, making live race insights available to the platform.
